# HULK - HTTP Unbearable Load King (DDoS Script)

A Python script designed for educational purposes to demonstrate and understand certain types of Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, specifically those targeting web servers with a high volume of unique HTTP GET requests.

## üìú Overview

### What Is A DDoS Attack?

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming the target or its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by utilizing multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack traffic.

These attacks can target a wide array of important resources, from e-commerce sites and online banking platforms to news websites, presenting a significant challenge in maintaining the availability and accessibility of critical online services.

## üéì Used in Research

This tool ("Hulk") was utilized in the following academic research for evaluating DDoS detection and prevention mechanisms:

*   **Title:** Detecting and Preventing Distributed Denial of Services (DDoS) Attacks using Machine Learning and Software Defined Networking
*   **Publication:** 2020 International Conference on Electrical, Communication, and Computer Engineering (ICECCE)
*   **Abstract/Link:** [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177002)

The paper mentions using HULK (HTTP Unbearable Load King) as a DDoS tool for evaluating their proposed framework.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

*   Python 2.x or Python 3.x (Python 3.x is recommended as Python 2.x is end-of-life)
*   `git` (for cloning the repository)

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/beezanX/Hulk
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Hulk
    ```

3.  **Run the script:**
    Execute the script using Python:
    ```bash
    python hulk.py <target_url>
    ```
    For example:
    ```bash
    python hulk.py http://example.com
    ```
    **Note:** Replace `http://example.com` with the URL of the target you have **explicit permission** to test against. Some versions of HULK might require configuring the target within the script itself if command-line arguments are not supported by your specific version.

The script is straightforward to run once Python is installed on your system.
